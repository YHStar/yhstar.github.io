Rare Atom have announced that they have completed the signing of E9 star Aojie "⁠Trash⁠" Tian to replace veteran HaoWen "⁠somebody⁠" Xu, who has been moved to the bench.

The change comes after a disappointing run of results from Rare Atom, who could not qualify for the Austin Major after finishing the China Regional Qualifier in third place, behind Lynn Vision and TYLOO.

Rare Atom went on to place 5th-6th in ESL Challenger Asia-Pacific and at the Hero Esports Asian Champions League, and second to TYLOO at XSE Pro League Chengdu.

The Chinese organization hopes that the injection of young blood will help the team return to the heights that saw it reach the Shanghai Major at the end of 2024. In a post on Weibo, Rare Atom praised Trash's "excellent performances" in both collegiate and professional tournaments.

somebody joined Rare Atom on loan from TYLOO in October 2023 before signing a permanent deal at the end of the year. He averaged a 1.09 rating while with the team, which now looks as follows:

```

China Yihang "⁠L1haNg⁠" Li
